There are 20 total bottles, 19 with 1 gram pills, and 1 with 1.1 gram pills. You have a scale that can only be used once. Find the heavy bottle.

The solution is to take a different amount of pills from each bottle (increasing from 1 to 20 or max bottles), get the weight with the scale, subtract the expected weight, and divide by the difference between a heavier pill (1.1g) and a normal pill (1g)

That looks like this:

bottle # = (actualWeight - expectedWeight) / (1.1 - 1)

This works because we now introduced an import factor to the problem. We took a unique number of pills from each bottle. The heavy bottle that had x amount of pills taken will account for the x*0.1 difference in expected and actual weights.
